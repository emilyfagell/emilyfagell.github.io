  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h3>What I do, Where I'm From, and a Fun Fact</h3>
  <p>I am a student completing Lab Assignment 3.</p>
  <p>I go to Dartmouth College. I am originally from Bethesda, Maryland. I have a 10-pound dog named Moose. A couple of years ago, my mom posted a photograph of Moose online. After doing so, the CEO of Big League Chew saw the photo and reached out; he wanted Moose to be the Big League Chew "Dog of the Year." Moose had a photoshoot, and his photo, name, and story were printed on hundreds of packs of gum!</p>
